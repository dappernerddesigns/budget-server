# Budget tracking server

### A small back end project to display savings goals or outstanding loans

---

I made this server so that I could generate a solid front end to visualise savings pots and outstanding loan amounts. The server is not linked to any banking applications and does rely on users updating their pots accordingly.

This is a **very** basic server that does currently show all data on the endpoints including passwords. This project is not intended in any way to hold any proprietary data or personal information.

## Current functionality

-   users can view their own table row
-   users can update any column on their row eg:password or username
-   users can create a new user row
-   users can view all associated pots with their user_id
-   users can add more pots associated with their user_id
-   users can update their pot information such as current amount, notes or pot name

## Functionality outstanding

-   [] Complete error handling
